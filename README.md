# Mobile Flashcards Project

The Mobile Flash cards is a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) 
that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow 
users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add 
flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-native-app.
